# Analyze Stroop Effect

In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). I created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the test, looked at data collected on the actual outcome of the test and computed statistics describing the results. Ultimately, I interpreted the results in terms of my hypothesis.

## Components

- Identify components of an experiment
- Use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
- Set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample and draw conclusions based on the results

## Workflow Setup

Create a Python environment in Jupyter Notebook with the following packages:
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
- [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)
